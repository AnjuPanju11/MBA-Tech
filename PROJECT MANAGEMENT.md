📘🧩 UNIT 1: PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS & SELECTION

🔹 Q1. What is Project Management?
👉 Definition: Project management is the process of leading a team to achieve specific goals within a time limit and budget.
📌 Key elements: Planning, Scheduling, Executing, Monitoring, Controlling
💡 Example: Constructing a shopping mall – you plan the layout, hire workers, monitor progress, and handover before deadline.

🔹 Q2. What are the phases of the Project Management Life Cycle?
📌 Five Key Phases:
1. Initiation 🔍 – Idea, feasibility
2. Planning 📋 – Timeline, cost, scope
3. Execution 🚧 – Work starts
4. Monitoring 🕵️‍♂️ – Progress tracking
5. Closure ✅ – Final delivery, feedback

💡 Example: Making a YouTube channel – you plan content (planning), shoot videos (execution), check views (monitoring), then improve or close.

🔹 Q3. What are sources of new project ideas?
📌 Sources:
- Market Demand 📊
- New Technology ⚙️
- Customer Complaints 🗣️
- R&D or Innovations 🔬

💡 Example: Swiggy started as a response to demand for home food delivery.

🔹 Q4. What is Project Selection? Mention models.
👉 Project selection is choosing the best possible project to invest in.
📌 Models:
- Payback Period 💰 (quick return?)
- NPV (Net Present Value) 📈 (profitability?)
- Scoring Model 🎯 (points system)

💡 Example: You compare launching an online course or opening a bakery based on profits and effort.

🔹 Q5. What is Market and Demand Analysis?
👉 It studies the potential demand for a product/service.
📌 Steps: Define Market ➝ Estimate Demand ➝ Forecast ➝ Competitor Check
💡 Example: Ola checked if Indian users wanted app-based taxi booking before launching.

📘👨‍💼 UNIT 2: PROJECT MANAGER, ORGANIZATION & PLANNING

🔹 Q6. Who is a Project Manager? What are their roles?
👉 A Project Manager (PM) leads the team and ensures the project is completed successfully.
📌 Roles:
- Planning Master 📋
- Risk Handler ⚠️
- Team Motivator 🙌
- Progress Tracker 📊

💡 Example: In IT projects, PM ensures coding, testing, and launching all happen on time.

🔹 Q7. What are types of Project Organization Structures?
📌 Types:
- Functional 🧩 (departments like HR, Finance)
- Projectized 🏗️ (PM has full control)
- Matrix 🔀 (mixed reporting)

💡 Example: In a matrix company, a web designer reports to both Marketing head and Project Manager.

🔹 Q8. What is a Project Management Office (PMO)?
👉 A PMO is a special unit that sets project standards, templates, tools, and reviews.
💡 Example: Big IT firms use PMO to maintain consistency across multiple software projects.

🔹 Q9. What is Project Planning?
👉 It’s the step where the complete roadmap of the project is created.
📌 Includes: Goals, Tasks, Timeline, Budget, Risks
💡 Example: Planning a college fest includes dates, venue, budget, volunteers, and sponsors.

📘🛠️ UNIT 3: IMPLEMENTATION, SCHEDULING, PERT/CPM

🔹 Q10. What is Budgeting & Cost Estimation?
👉 Budgeting: Allocating funds
👉 Estimation: Predicting cost in advance
📌 Steps: Resource Cost + Labor Cost + Buffer

💡 Example: For a restaurant project: ₹5L for setup, ₹3L for salaries, ₹2L buffer.

🔹 Q11. What is Project Scheduling?
👉 Scheduling is about assigning timelines to tasks.
📌 Tools: Gantt Chart, Calendar, MS Project

💡 Example: Website Project → Week 1: Design | Week 2: Coding | Week 3: Testing

🔹 Q12. What is PERT?
👉 PERT = Program Evaluation and Review Technique
📌 Used when time is uncertain.
🧠 Formula:
`Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6`

💡 Example: Making an app feature:
- Optimistic: 2 days
- Likely: 4 days
- Pessimistic: 6 days
➡️ Expected = (2+16+6)/6 = 4 days

🔹 Q13. What is CPM?
👉 CPM = Critical Path Method
📌 Shows longest path & important tasks. Delays in these delay the whole project.

💡 Example: If steel delivery is delayed in bridge construction, everything else halts.

🔹 Q14. What is Project Crashing?
👉 It means reducing time by adding resources.
📌 Goal: Finish earlier, even if it costs more

💡 Example: Hiring extra painters to finish house before Diwali.

🔹 Q15. What is Network Construction?
👉 It’s a diagram showing task order using nodes & arrows.
📌 Tools: PERT chart, CPM chart

💡 Example: Making pizza: Prepare dough → Add toppings → Bake → Serve

📘⚙️ UNIT 4: RESOURCE ALLOCATION & CHALLENGES

🔹 Q16. What is Resource Allocation?
👉 Assigning available resources to project tasks.
📌 Resources: Human, Financial, Material, Equipment

💡 Example: For an ad shoot: Camera = 1, Actor = 2, Time = 3 hours

🔹 Q17. What are the types of Project Resources?
📌 1. Work Resources (people)
📌 2. Material Resources (bricks, wires)
📌 3. Cost Resources (money, rent)

💡 Example: In road construction – labor (work), cement (material), ₹50L (cost)

🔹 Q18. What is Resource Loading and Leveling?
👉 Loading = Total assigned work  
👉 Leveling = Adjusting work to avoid overload

💡 Example: If one designer has 10 tasks and another has 2, distribute evenly = leveling.

📘📊 UNIT 5: MONITORING, CONTROL & REVIEW

🔹 Q19. What is Project Monitoring?
👉 Keeping track of progress vs. plan
📌 Monitors: Cost, Time, Quality, Scope

💡 Example: Check daily sales vs. expected target in a marketing project.

🔹 Q20. Explain Planning–Monitoring–Controlling Cycle.
📌 Cycle:
1. Plan 📋
2. Monitor 🕵️
3. Control 🔧

💡 Example: Plan to build a school in 6 months → Monitor every 2 weeks → Fix delays by hiring more labor = control.

🔹 Q21. What are the types of Project Control?
📌 1. Time Control ⏳ – Stay on schedule  
📌 2. Cost Control 💸 – Avoid over-budget  
📌 3. Quality Control ✅ – Maintain standards

💡 Example: If lights are over-budget, switch to local vendor = cost control.

🔹 Q22. What are Administrative Aspects in Project Review?
📌 Includes:
- Reports 📄
- Staff Performance 🧑‍💼
- Lessons Learned 💡
- Final Summary 🔚

💡 Example: After an event, submit report showing what worked, what didn’t, and team feedback.
