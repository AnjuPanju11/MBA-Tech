---

ðŸ”¹ Q8. What is a Project Management Office (PMO)?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: A PMO is a centralized team or department that sets standards, practices, templates, and supports project managers.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
Big IT companies use PMO to maintain standard practices across all teams to ensure quality and consistency.

---

ðŸ”¹ Q9. What is Project Planning?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: Project planning involves preparing a detailed roadmap of how the project will be executed and monitored.

ðŸ“Œ Includes:
- Defining scope and objectives
- Breaking tasks into schedules
- Assigning roles and responsibilities
- Planning budget and risks

ðŸ’¡ Example:
Planning a college fest involves tasks like venue booking, team setup, sponsor arrangement, and budget allocation.

=================================================================

ðŸ“˜ UNIT 3: IMPLEMENTATION, SCHEDULING, PERT & CPM

ðŸ”¹ Q10. What is Budgeting & Cost Estimation?
ðŸ‘‰ Budgeting: Allocating money for the entire project.
ðŸ‘‰ Estimation: Predicting the total cost before the project begins.

ðŸ“Œ Components:
- Resource Cost
- Labor Charges
- Risk Buffer

ðŸ’¡ Example:
A restaurant project needs â‚¹5 lakh for setup, â‚¹3 lakh for staff salaries, and â‚¹2 lakh as a buffer.

---

ðŸ”¹ Q11. What is Project Scheduling?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: Scheduling is assigning start and end times to project tasks to manage completion timelines.

ðŸ“Œ Tools:
- Gantt Charts
- Timeline View
- Project Management Software

ðŸ’¡ Example:
Website Project:
Week 1 â€“ Design  
Week 2 â€“ Coding  
Week 3 â€“ Testing and Launch

---

ðŸ”¹ Q12. What is PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: PERT is a project management tool used to estimate uncertain activity durations.

ðŸ“Œ Formula:
Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4 Ã— Most Likely + Pessimistic) Ã· 6

ðŸ’¡ Example:
App feature timeline:  
Optimistic = 2 days  
Most Likely = 4 days  
Pessimistic = 6 days  
Expected = (2 + 4Ã—4 + 6)/6 = 4 days

---

ðŸ”¹ Q13. What is CPM (Critical Path Method)?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: CPM identifies the longest path of dependent activities in a project that determines the shortest completion time.

ðŸ“Œ Importance:
Delay in critical tasks = delay in project

ðŸ’¡ Example:
In bridge construction, delay in steel delivery delays the whole project.

---

ðŸ”¹ Q14. What is Project Crashing?
ðŸ‘‰ Definition: Crashing means reducing project time by adding more resources (extra people or machines).
