---

🔹 Q7. What are the types of Project Organization Structures?
📌 **Types:**
1. 🧩 **Functional:** Based on departments (HR, Finance) – PM has less authority
2. 🏗️ **Projectized:** Full-time project teams – PM has full control
3. 🔀 **Matrix:** Hybrid of both – employees report to two bosses

💡 **Example:** In a matrix setup, a graphic designer may report to both the Marketing Manager and Project Manager.

---

🔹 Q8. What is a Project Management Office (PMO)?
👉 **Definition:** A PMO is a centralized department that ensures standardized project practices across the organization.

📌 **Functions:**
- Create templates and tools
- Guide PMs with processes
- Monitor all projects

💡 **Example:** An IT firm’s PMO maintains Gantt chart templates, quality checklists, and project documentation formats.

---

🔹 Q9. What is Project Planning?
👉 **Definition:** Project planning involves defining project scope, goals, tasks, timelines, resources, risks, and communication plans.

📌 **Includes:**
- Timeline
- Budget
- Milestones
- Task Assignments
- Risk Plans

💡 **Example:** Planning a college fest involves assigning committees, managing funds, setting dates, booking venues, etc.

---

📘🛠️ UNIT 3: IMPLEMENTATION, SCHEDULING, PERT/CPM

🔹 Q10. What is Budgeting & Cost Estimation?
👉 **Budgeting:** Setting a financial limit
👉 **Estimation:** Predicting how much the project will cost

📌 **Steps:**
- Calculate Material Cost
- Add Labor Cost
- Include Buffer for Unexpected Costs

💡 **Example:** A restaurant startup may plan ₹5L for kitchen setup, ₹3L for staff salaries, and ₹2L for buffer = ₹10L total.

---

🔹 Q11. What is Project Scheduling?
👉 **Definition:** Scheduling assigns specific start and end dates to tasks in a project.

📌 **Tools Used:**
- Gantt Chart
- Calendar View
- Software like MS Project

💡 **Example:** Website Development Project:
- Week 1: Design UI
- Week 2: Develop Backend
- Week 3: Testing & Deployment

---

🔹 Q12. What is PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)?
👉 **Definition:** PERT is a time estimation technique for uncertain activities.

📌 **Formula:**  
`Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6`

💡 **Example:**
- Optimistic: 2 days
- Most Likely: 4 days
- Pessimistic: 6 days  
➡️ Expected Time = (2 + 16 + 6) / 6 = 4 days

---

🔹 Q13. What is CPM (Critical Path Method)?
👉 **Definition:** CPM identifies the longest sequence of dependent activities (critical path) which must be completed on time.

📌 **Importance:** Delay in these tasks causes overall delay.

💡 **Example:** If cement delivery in bridge construction is late, the entire construction is delayed.

---

🔹 Q14. What is Project Crashing?
👉 **Definition:** Crashing is reducing project duration by adding extra resources, often at higher cost.

📌 **Used When:** Project is behind schedule or deadline is preponed
